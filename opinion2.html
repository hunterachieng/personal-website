        <h4>Trevor Noah: Born a Crime <br>
            Humor</h4>
        <p>
            Noah did not grow up with a lot of luxury and throughout his childhood life, 
            he had to go through many difficult situations that the majority were as a result of his skin color and family situation. 
            Although he went through these struggles, he uses humor in his story to explain the funny side of a difficult situation. 
            Noah uses humor to get out of a difficult situation at the start of the book when he states 
            “She broke into a huge smile and started laughing. I started laughing, too, ... laughing together through the pain in the light of a petrol station on the side of the road in the middle of the night .” 
The events that preceded the above phrase would have scared any human being and no one would have had the strength to laugh. 
Nevertheless, Noah and his mother did not let these events rob them of their happiness as the little time they spent laughing helped them get rid of the fear they felt since they almost lost their lives. </p>
<p>
When Noah was in high school, he explains that he was not as popular, and being mixed-race meant he lacked a group to connect with as his mates always stuck together in various cliques. 
To avoid stepping on anyone’s toes and to ensure that he did not spend all his recess time alone, he used humor to make friends. 
Since Noah was not affiliated with any group, his humor helped him relate and interact with members from every group with ease. 
</p>
<p>
After Noah’s mother had been shot by Abel, he was sitting by her bedside waiting for her to come through.
 When she woke up, instead of wallowing in her misery and wondering why such a thing happened to her, 
 she informed her son that he would now be the best-looking person in the family, 
 a statement that had both of them laughing through the pain together just as they did in the light of the petrol station years ago.</p>
 <p>
Noah also used humor to escape the reality that he could have lost his mother when he decided to tease her as they were leaving the hospital by stating
 “ But where was your Jesus to pay your hospital bill, hmm? I know for a fact that He didn’t pay that.”
  In his statement, Noah is teasing his mother for not having medical insurance where she claimed that Jesus was her insurance.
   At a time when Noah would have been worried for the safety of his mother given that Abel only got probation, 
   he is still remembering the words of his mother as he was a child to never dwell on the past as nothing good ever comes from it. 
Noah’s use of humor in tough times teaches that regardless of what you are going through, it is you to chose whether to dwell on the bad or find the humor in it and move on.
 Through humor, we can heal from tragedies that would have taken years to overcome.

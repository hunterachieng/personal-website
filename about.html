                Hunter Achieng is a 24-year-old young woman from Nairobi Kenya. 
                The eldest of four, she has grown up to be a leader, provider, and substitute parent to her siblings. 
                Hunter has developed several interests in forensic science, foreign languages, and recently, technology. <br>
               In foreign languages, she has conquered her fears of the unknown and managed to not only understand, but also speak several foreign languages such as Korean, Chinese, German, and Thai.
                 When Hunter is not studying, you will find her practicing her Chinese characters, and during the weekends, she would be engrossed in her weekly distressing Asian dramas.

            <p>When she completed her high school education in 2014, 
                the lack of funds prevented her from pursuing her dreams despite getting a placement at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) to pursue a BSc. Innovation Technology Management.
                Although she also got accepted into Ontario University of Technology for BSc Honors Forensic Science,her financial status prevented her from walking down this path.
                 Instead of wallowing in her misery, she took it upon herself to learn Academic Writing, a freelance job of writing assignments for university students based abroad.
                  She used her earnings to support the family where she can until 2021 when she joined AkiraChix.

                Hunter has grown up in a large family for most of her life. 
                Her mother being as generous as she is, welcomed her nieces and nephews who have been switching places with each other every few years.<br>
                 As a result, the Ochieng household has never been dull, with laughter, stories, and endless games filling the house every day. 
                 Growing in this noisy environment which was often full of boys, taught her how to live with people. <br>
                 "I do not remember our house ever being empty, there is always someone somewhere doing something.
                  Sometimes it is a market, and other times it is so quiet with only the sounds from the television." Hunter states as she laughs.

            <p>As her mother always says ‘what goes around comes around.’ 
                This quote has been the mantra of the Ochieng household with every decision made with the thought of the consequences that would occur soon. <br>
                Coming from a humble background, life has taught her to appreciate the little she has, and work hard to improve the lives of her family members.
                 Now in AkiraChix, she hopes that God would use her to fulfill her family members’ prayers, hopes, and wishes.
                  With all those people waiting on her success, she is determined not to let anything stop her from making them happy, as it is said, ‘the smile of your loved ones is the greatest reward’.

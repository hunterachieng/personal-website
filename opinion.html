        <h4>Trevor Noah: Born a Crime <br>
            Submissive vs Independent Women</h4>
        <p>
            A strong woman has never been accepted in traditional African society.
             From the book, the writer states that the level of independence and strong-headedness of his mother caused a rift between his mother and her new husband,
              Abel especially after they returned from Abel’s maternal home where Patricia refused to conform to their norms. 
              A traditional woman is submissive, a story that my mother always repeats as well.
               I think that regardless of the timeframe, independent women are those who have made great changes not only in the lives of their children but the world as well. 
               </p>
               <p>
Although being submissive is a preference, forcing one to become submissive is an illustration of the lack of confidence a man has in himself. 
Abel’s frustrations when Patricia quit her job and helped improve the garage business is a clear illustration of toxic masculinity. 
Out of her love for her husband and her desire to protect her investment, she decided to quit a secure and well-paying job to help out and instead of receiving gratitude for her sacrifice, Abel gets frustrated. 
Patricia’s story is quite similar to the late Dr.Wangari Maathai whose husband divorced her citing claims that Maathai was too strong-headed and could not be controlled.
Being a woman myself, I feel that men want us to be subservient to allow them to bask in the glory of being a provider as it is registered in their DNA,
 forgetting that women are not interested in competing with them but desire their freedom to pursue their dreams. </p>
 <p>
Trevor mentions in his book that men go for independent women for them to be caged and exert their control over them.
 Since the writer grew up during the apartheid, black men were feeling the pressure of the regime where their every move was controlled and decided by the white men. 
 Feeling that their masculinity was limited in the outside world, they sought out an environment private enough to allow them to exert their authority freely. 
 The perfect environment was their homes where they even bragged that they showed their affection to their women by beating them, an act of violence that was misinterpreted for love.
In conclusion, Patricia is a role model to many women and myself as she reminds us that however much someone wants to bring you down for being yourself, you should hold your head up even higher than before.
